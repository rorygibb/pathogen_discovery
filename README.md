# How stable and reliable are order- and species-level virus diversity estimates?

Code repository for Discovery MS, examining: (1) temporal trends in virus discovery rates in mammals at the species and order levels (are discovery rates reaching an inflection point for well sampled species and orders?), and (2) temporal stability in relative viral diversity estimates across species and orders (how stable are our inferences about host-level viral diversity over time?)
